MEDICAL COST PREDICTION USING LINEAR REGRESSION
This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict medical insurance costs based on various factors. It uses Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
The aim of this project is to predict the medical insurance cost for individuals based on factors like age, gender, BMI, children, smoking habits, and region. Linear regression is employed to analyze the relationship between these features and insurance costs.
